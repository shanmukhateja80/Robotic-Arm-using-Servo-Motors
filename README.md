# Robotic-Arm-using-Servo-Motors
Developed a robotic arm controlled by servo motors, with each joint's movement regulated by potentiometers. The system allows precise control of the arm's position, enabling predefined tasks through programmed sequences. Real-time adjustments are made by varying potentiometer values, ensuring flexibility and accuracy in task execution.
